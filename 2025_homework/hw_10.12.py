# write a function to print all values that are greater than small
# and less than big in the list

'''
hints: 1) write a for loop to read each value in the list
       2) for each value, first compare if the value is greater than small and 
         second compare if the value is less than big; Or you can do the 
         comparison the other way around
      3) print values that are greater than small and less than big
